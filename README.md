# VouchIT - Consumer-Driven Product Rating Platform

**VouchIT** is a web-based platform where users can share reviews for products, and those reviews directly influence the product's overall rating. This system prioritises community voice and offers more transparent, sentiment-aware insights into how a product truly performs.

## ðŸ“š Academic Context

This project was developed as part of the **Web Technology** course at **Galgotias University**. It also integrates a **Sentiment Analyzer** built for the **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** subject â€” both are academic projects demonstrating the practical application of full-stack development and NLP techniques.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

When a user submits a review:
- The **Sentiment Analyzer** (custom-built for an NLP course) processes the text.
- It classifies the review as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**.
- Based on this classification, the product rating is automatically adjusted â€” allowing ratings to reflect not just scores, but actual sentiment expressed by users.

## ðŸ’¡ Features

- Real-time product ratings based on actual review sentiments.
- Clean, minimalist UI for a distraction-free user experience.
- Honest community-driven review system â€” no manual rating entry.
- Hosted online and accessible for demo and review.
